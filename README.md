## Zeeman lab
first run zeeman_peaks.py, get a cvs with the fitted gaussian profiles, remmeber to change settings in main() to match the dataset. play around with fit parameters.
zeeman_peaks.py will generate interactive plots, click on the coordinate on the plot BEFORE the first p value to exclue the central ring. The coordinates will be automatically recorded in the output.
then go through the steps in zeeman.ipynb
